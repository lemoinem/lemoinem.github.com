Hello there,

From time to time, I have a few idea, tips, solutions to a problem that bothered
my for several days or simply neat pieces of code that I want to keep in one
corner of the Internet for later use.

I think it would be selfish to keep these for myself, and if they may ever be
useful to someone else, well, there you go! Unless mentioned otherwise or being
own by someone else, every piece of code you'll find here is under my favorite
license: [BSD-3](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause). Feels free to use
it and adapt it yourself and if you have any kind of improvements, to suggest,
I'll be happy to hear about it.

Don't expect any kind of regular or high-profile posting here, it's just my
little corner of the Internet that could be useful to you too!
