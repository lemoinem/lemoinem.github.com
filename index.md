Hello there,

From time to time, I have a few idea, tips, solutions to a problem that bothered
me for several days or simply neat pieces of code that I want to keep in one
corner of the Internet for later use.

I think it would be selfish to keep these for myself, and if they may ever be
useful to someone else, well, there you go! Unless mentioned otherwise or being
own by someone else, every piece of code you'll find here is under my favorite
license: [BSD-3](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-3-clause), under the same
reservations, the rest of the text and content is licensed
[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Feels free to use
it and adapt it yourself and if you have any kind of improvements,
I'll be happy to hear about it. In particular, translation is encouraged if you
feel it could be useful to someone else (again, although not a requirement, droping
a note would be nice ;) ). To contact me, you can do it either through github or via
blog@mlemoine.name.

Don't expect any kind of regular or high-profile posting here, it's just my
little corner of the Internet that could be useful to you too!
