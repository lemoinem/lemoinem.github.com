# lemoinem's blog

Here is the source for my blog <http://blog.mlemoine.name>. The source code of
the `_layouts` is inspired from the [Jekyll modernist
theme](https://github.com/orderedlist/modernist) and the [gitwatcher blog source
code](https://github.com/lgs/gitwatcher-blog).

Minor modfications have been made to the modernist template scss.
